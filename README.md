ErrorSolver
==============

This is a python script that searches and displays possible solutions to compiler runtime errors using the google search api

First make the script executable unless it already is

    $ chmod +x errorsolve.py

Run the python executable with the python program you would like to test for errors

    $ ./errorsolve.py python filename.py
